## 📌 About the Challenge  
This repository is a submission for the **Pixel Perfect Challenge**.  
The goal of this challenge was to replicate the **Flair.ai** landing page as close to pixel-perfect as possible, without implementing its backend functionality.  

---

## 🛠️ My Approach  
- I first **inspected and grabbed all the media assets** (images, icons, etc.) directly from the original website using browser dev tools.  
- Initially, I considered using **heavy frameworks** like React for building the page.  
- Later, I realized the challenge **only required the landing page**, not the complete functionality.  
- So, I focused on **replicating the design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** only.  

---

## 🎨 Styling & Design  
- I **closely studied the CSS** of the original site and recreated styles to ensure accuracy.  
- Since I have experience building **15+ public projects** and currently working with **multiple MNCs on live projects**, handling CSS styling and JavaScript interactions came naturally.  
- The project emphasizes **pixel-perfect precision** in layout, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling & responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – Minor interactions  

No external heavy frameworks were used — keeping it **lightweight and efficient**.
