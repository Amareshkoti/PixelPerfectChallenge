## 📌 About the Challenge  
This repository is a submission for the **Pixel Perfect Challenge**.  
The goal of this challenge was to replicate the **Flair.ai** landing page as close to pixel-perfect as possible, without implementing its backend functionality.  

---

## 🛠️ My Approach  
- I first **inspected and grabbed all the media assets** (images, icons, etc.) directly from the original website using browser dev tools.  
- Initially, I considered using **heavy frameworks** like React for building the page.  
- Later, I realized the challenge **only required the landing page**, not the complete functionality.  
- So, I focused on **replicating the design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** only.

## 🎨 Styling & Design  
- I **closely studied the CSS** of the original site and recreated styles to ensure accuracy.  
- Handling CSS styling and JavaScript interactions is the major thing in this Project.  
- The project emphasizes **pixel-perfect precision** in layout, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling & responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – Minor interactions  

No external heavy frameworks were used — keeping it **lightweight and efficient**.

## 📂 Project Structure


The PixelPerfectChallenge project is organized into a clear structure. It contains an assets folder that stores all media files such as images, icons, and fonts. The index.html file serves as the main landing page of the project. Styling is handled by the style.css file, which defines the custom design and appearance. Finally, the script.js file manages the JavaScript interactions, making the project dynamic and interactive.
